This is my website. For now, the contents of this repository is written using Blazor WebAssembly, and deployed to two places:

* [Netlify](https://determined-austin-2fb7e9.netlify.app/)
* [GitHub Pages](https://cruciformhawk7.github.io/)

The main aim of this project is not just to have a fancier website that is interactive, but explore [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/CruciformHawk7/nikhilhariwebsite/actions). Suggestions and fixes are always welcome. The project uses the following actions: 

* [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) for hosting release onto GitHub Pages. Huge shoutout to your actions, its just simpler and easier to understand. Took me forever to find, 5 minutes to install.
* [netlify/actions/cli@master](https://github.com/netlify/actions) for Netlify push command. 
* [actions/setup-dotnet@v1](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) for .NET setup. 

Have fun lurking!
